You can see that we did a fast forward merge because there were no branches that diverge from the develop branch. Additionally, all branches were merged with the develop branch at the time of the merge.

Merge Conflict Scenario: In a collaborative project, the "develop" branch focuses on implementing new features, while the "conflict_branch" addresses a critical bug fix. Both branches concurrently modify a fundamental function within a shared file, leading to conflicting changes. When attempting to merge the branches, Git encounters a merge conflict, requiring manual intervention to adjust the differing alterations and ensure the codebase remains functional and coherent.
